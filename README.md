# HACKSITE

Hacksite is my take on the typical TODO list. Focusing in simple and achievable iterations containing only four tasks at a time. Instead of seeing a possibly overwhelming amount of stuff to do you'll only see four (hopefully small) tasks.

Hacksite is currently in ALPHA stage and has a few major features to be built in before it is ready for BETA.

The major features that need to be in place can be found in the [Hacksite Beta](https://github.com/darwinfroese/hacksite/projects/1) project under the projects tab.


## Server

The backend is written in Golang and serves as an API where all the heavy lifting is done as well as a file server for the web client.

## Web Client

The web client is written in Vue.js 2 and serves as an interface to the backend where as much of the heavy lifting as possible should be completed.
